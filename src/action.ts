/**
 * An `Action` is a plain object that represents an intention to change
 * the state. Actions are the only way to send data to the store and emit
 * a state change.
 *
 * Actions must have a `type` field that indicates the type of action being
 * performed. Types can be defined as constants and imported from another
 * module. Itâ€™s better to use strings for `type` than Symbols because strings
 * are serializable.
 *
 * If you need additional data to process an action use the `payload` property.
 * Extend `Action` to specify the `payload` and have intellisense inside a
 * `Reducer`.
